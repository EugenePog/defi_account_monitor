Due to constraints in accessing real-time data directly from blockchain explorers or APIs, I am unable to provide a live table-based report for the Ethereum address 0xeb528631afefd84c69a20e6d270adf9bebbd4e38. However, you can manually check the token holdings and DeFi protocol information by visiting a blockchain explorer such as Etherscan or Ethplorer. By inputting the address, you can view real-time data, including a list of assets held, their respective amounts, and any associated DeFi protocols. For structured and automated data retrieval, utilizing APIs from these services would be recommended to build a detailed and dynamic report.
